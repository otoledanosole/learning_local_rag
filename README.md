# Creation of a Local Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

In this post we are going to be looking at how to create a simple local RAG to run locally on a GPU or to run it on Google Colab

The purpose of this document is to document step by step the entire personal learning process of creating a RAG.
The information in this post should not be taken as a reference or as a guide since the only objective is to document the progress.
